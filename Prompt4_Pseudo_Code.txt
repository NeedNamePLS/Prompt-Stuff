{
	variables
	
	prompt user for password
	if correct -> work as normal
	else -> closes program

	prompt user which way to convert decimal and roman numerals

	(Decimal to Roman)
	while loop to constantly compare the inputed value and take away from a temp value
	all while printing the equivalent Roman version until temp is = to 0

	(Roman to Decimal)
	//sin incarnate
	Lots of if statements and for loops to prevent wrong numeral values
	while correct ones are adding the values together

	//this made me sad
