The user will input a "field" string and a "search" string
the "field" string is the base string that will be prodded and searched
the "search" string is the substring that we are looking for in the "field" string (Just like the TSA)
Then the program will search for a first occurrence and a second one if applicable
If not it will state it could not find it and blame Travis
