Code prompts user to decided to go from either Decimal to Roman or Roman to Decimal
Decimal to Roman takes the inputed value and creates a temp value to be put through
the if statement gauntlet constantly checking its value and substracting from it and printing
a Roman numeral equivalent. Roman to Decimal puts it through a different if/for loop gauntlet
that checks if the input is a valid number then checks the valid answer and += values to the temp
until the program reaches the end of the input.
